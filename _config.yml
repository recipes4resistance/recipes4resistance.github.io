# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  We provide a platform for minoritized voices to discuss how to foster 
  equity in Computer Science (CS) and CS Education (CSE) fields. We seek to elevate voices 
  and ideas beyond those traditionally centered, including CS teachers, 
  parents, students, and community members whose lived experiences 
  include doing work by and for their communities.
