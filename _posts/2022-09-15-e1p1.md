## Overview
For our first episode we're unpacking the concept of *resistance*, especially in computing and computing education. *What **is** resistance? What is being resist**ed**? How **do** we resist?*

We encourage you to engage with the resources below to become more familiar with the topic of *resistance* before engaging with the kitchen-table talk in part 2 (to be released soon!). The resources below were curated by our kitchen-table talk guest speakers-- among many others, these resources have helped inform their scholarship and their own lived resistance.
