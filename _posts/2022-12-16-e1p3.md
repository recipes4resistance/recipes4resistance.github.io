## Conversation Overview and Highlights
In [part 2 of this episode](/2022/11/11/e1p2), we talked about the idea of resistance and what it looks like in computing education. We asked: 
- What does resistance mean to you? 
- What are we resisting? 
- Why is resistance important? 
- What does resistance sound like or look like?

## Reflections and Ponderings

We created word clouds from our conversations as well as [The Papaya Project's Open Letter To The CS Ed Community](https://the-papaya-project.github.io/letter). The first three images are centered around our conversations of *why* we're resisting, *what* we're resisting, and *how* we're doing so. In the word clouds below, the larger a word is, the more frequently it came up in our conversation.
