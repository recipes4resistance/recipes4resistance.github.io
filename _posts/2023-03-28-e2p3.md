## Conversation Overview and Highlights
In [part 2 of this episode](/2023/02/14/e2p2), we talked about about resisting institutions, namely resisting academia, problematic K-12 norms, systems of power and oppression, and other harmful spaces. Tune in as they unpack resistance, rest, and refusal.

## Reflections and Ponderings
> Thank you to our wonderful podcast audience member, Alex Gore, who wrote this episode's reflections and ponderings. 

I am a student in a class taught by one of the hosts of this podcast, Briana Bettin. The class is titled
"Reimagining Technofuturism" and is about reimaging computing in ways that center people and
communities. The day that this podcast came out, in class we were talking about how we could frame
ourselves in relation to systems of power in regard to the larger topic of data set curation and use and
how we leverage data and datasets.

That day in class we had watched [a video about bell hooks talking about interlocking systems of
domination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUpY8PZlgV8) and it reminded me of this podcast. I remember sitting in class thinking about how in the podcast, Shana and Nicki were talking about this idea of race and that the term *racism* wasn’t used as much as the term *white supremacy*. After I watched this, I think that some of it could have to do with bell hooks's idea that the term *racism* allows *white people* to be at the center of the discussion, whereas the term *white supremacy* doesn’t just evoke white people, but it evokes a political world that we all frame ourselves in relationship to.
