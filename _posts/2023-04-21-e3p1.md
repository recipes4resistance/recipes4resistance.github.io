<img class="col-10" src="/img/ep3.png" alt="Our logo on a deep purple background with colorful floral decorations around it. Text reads: Recipes for Resistance. Ep3: Teaching and Learning CS in a Pandemic. Our logo is a mortar made up of two uppercase R's with pestle inside. The two R's form two faces facing each other with a shared dream bubble with a heart inside. The colorful dainty growth on the pestle represents the growth and healing we hope the podcast creates. The floral accents in and on the bowl represent a garden from which our conversations are growing, with ideas blossoming within as we mix them up in our “cooking”. The faces “built in” to the R’s signify that we are a part of the mortar, where we’re making something beautiful together. Lastly, the dream bubble represents the ways we’re imagining and dreaming up love.">
