## Conversation Overview and Highlights
In [part 2 of this episode](/2023/05/31/e3p2), guest co-hosts [Adia Wallace](https://sites.northwestern.edu/adiawallace/) and Dr. Jen Tsan spoke with Esmeralda, Faythe, and Santiago, three K-12 Computer Science teachers. They shared their experiences teaching in the U.S. and Colombia and how they cultivated community and care despite the challenges brought on by the onset of the pandemic.

## Reflections and Ponderings
Dr. Tsan created two word clouds from the conversation. The first image is from teachers talking about teaching in a pandemic. The second is about how they resisted while teaching in a pandemic. In the word clouds below, the larger a word is, the more frequently it came up in the conversation.
