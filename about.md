## Recipes for Resistance

We are a team of early-career computer science education (CSE) researchers who identify and critically address inequities and bias in CSE to transform the space into a more equitable field. 

### A Multi-Modal Podcast Centering Justice, Joy, and Healing
The Recipes for Resistance Podcast is a multi-modal podcast series that provides a platform for minoritized voices to discuss how to foster equity in the CS and CS Education (CSE) fields. The podcast seeks to elevate voices and ideas beyond those traditionally centered, including CS teachers, parents, students, and community members whose lived experiences include doing work by and for their communities. Podcast episodes are crafted around a [kitchen table talk](#kitchen-table-talk), where we informally discuss the topic of choice and share stories, all while centering justice, joy, and healing. 

This podcast is a project funded by the [SIGCSE Special Projects Grant](https://sigcse.org/programs/special/2022.html). [SIGCSE](https://sigcse.org/about/profile.html) is an [ACM](https://www.acm.org) special interest group for computer science educators and CSE researchers. 

#### Kitchen Table Talks {#kitchen-table-talk}
We draw from the cultural tradition of "kitchen table talks" which designate the kitchen table for engaging in storytelling and conversations with family and the community [^Fierros] [^Guajardo] [^Haddix]. The kitchen table was "a protected, necessary space" for healing and transformation, providing a safe space from whiteness and trauma [^Bolding]. Episodes will be kitchen table talk “styled” conversations to create (1) a space of comfort and trust for free-flowing dialogue and (2) a "table" for minoritized scholars and participants who may have been denied seats at the dominant group's table [6].
